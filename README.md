# kesplash

Bash Splash!
From neofetch to pfetch...to just a little bit more up-time stats.

### Info
Uses 'last reboot' data (& such) to gather "approximate" data,
that is "good enough" for my desktop use, as terminal splash screen trivia - that only runs when I launch a Terminal window. No daemons or anything.
Customize directly in the script. Compatible with most shells & distros. Probably.

### Use
Run from the top of your .bashrc (or similar).
