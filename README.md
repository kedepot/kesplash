# kesplash

Bash Splash!
From neofetch to pfetch...to just a little bit more up-time stats.

### Info
- Uses 'last reboot' data (& such) to gather "approximate" data
- "Good enough" for my desktop use, as terminal splash screen trivia
- Only runs when called. (when I launch a Terminal window. No daemons or anything.)
- Customize directly in the script. 
- Compatible with most shells & distros. Probably.

Also included: kesplashup - the basic version, with just the colorized up-time:

### Use
Run kesplash (or kesplashup) from the top of your .bashrc (or similar).
& by all means, feel free to tweak the colours to whatever you prefer!
